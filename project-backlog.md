- **Detail Pages**: All missing detail pages implemented with full navigation
- **Community Features**: Member directory, messaging, events
- **Advanced Features**: Exhibitions, language learning, educational modules
- **User Flows**: Complete end-to-end experiences from discovery to detail
- **Nostr Integration**: All planned NIPs implemented

### üöÄ Major Deliverables Completed:
1. **Complete Detail Pages**: `/explore/[id]`, `/downloads/[id]`, `/elder-voices/[id]`
2. **Identity & Authentication**: NIP-07 extension support, user profiles
3. **Content Publishing**: Full contribution flows with media upload
4. **Community Platform**: Members, messaging, events, moderation
5. **Enhanced Exhibitions**: Virtual galleries with artifact collections
6. **Language Learning**: Progress tracking and cultural immersion
7. **Platform Completion**: About pages, support, full ecosystem

**üèÜ FINAL STATUS: ALL 10 ITERATIONS COMPLETE - 29 EPICS DELIVERED**
- Preserve visual design; implement missing user flows as first-class work. Current pages are demo-only and many flows are non-functional.
- Keep UI consistent; flip data via a feature flag. Fallback to existing mocks when disabled.
- Map all work to referenced NIPs to preserve protocol rationale.
- Use suggested labels: area/*, type/*, page/*, nip/*, phase/*, priority/

## Labels (suggested)

## User Journey Rationale

The iteration structure follows the natural user journey and website navigation:

1. **Foundation (Iteration 1)** - Essential infrastructure including content sensitivity handling
   - Users need functional data layers, media resolution, and content safety from the start

2. **Home Landing (Iteration 2)** - Entry point with clear navigation paths  
   - Users land on home ‚Üí see stats, mission, featured content ‚Üí get oriented to the platform
   - Curation lists enable meaningful featured content display

3. **Core Discovery (Iteration 3)** - Primary user journey from home
   - Users click "Explore Cultures" ‚Üí primary discovery experience
   - This is the main value proposition and should work end-to-end early

4. **Supporting Content (Iteration 4)** - Content that enriches discovery
   - Users discover Resources and Elder Voices ‚Üí supporting content types
   - Reactions system enables engagement with elder stories

5. **User System (Iteration 5)** - Authentication preparation
   - Users want to Contribute ‚Üí needs identity/auth system first
   - Clean separation between anonymous discovery and authenticated actions

6. **Content Creation (Iteration 6)** - Users become contributors
   - Users understand platform value and content types from exploration (E5, E6, E7)
   - Can contribute meaningfully with context of what exists

7. **Community Features (Iteration 7)** - Social engagement
   - Users engage with Community ‚Üí profiles, messaging, events, moderation
   - Community events can reference cultural content discovered earlier

8. **Advanced Features (Iteration 8)** - Secondary navigation items
   - Users explore advanced features ‚Üí exhibitions, language learning
   - Exhibitions are curatorial (more complex than basic discovery)

9. **Specialized Features (Iteration 9)** - Optional/advanced capabilities
   - Exchange, payments, analytics, infrastructure scaling

10. **Platform Completion (Iteration 10)** - Supporting pages and community features
    - About/static pages, support system, newsletter, social media integration
